# OptiQ-Flow
OptiQ-Flow is a quantum-powered portfolio optimization system built for real NISQ hardware. It uses QAOA with advanced error mitigation to overcome noise in quantum devices. By comparing runs with and without mitigation, it proves improved accuracy, enabling reliable, real-time financial optimization on quantum hardware.
